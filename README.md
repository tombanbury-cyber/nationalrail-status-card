# Lovelace Nationalrail Status Card
A status card for [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant) Lovelace UI for showing the current status of trains running from a station.

The card works with entities from within the **sensor**  domain and is intended to be used with entities from the [National Rail API Integration](https://github.com/jfparis/homeassistant_nationalrail).

## Install

### HACS (recommended) 

This card is not yet available in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store) directly but can still be added manually.
<small>*HACS is a third party community store and is not included in Home Assistant out of the box.*</small>

1. Open HACS and navigate to Custom Repositories.

2. Select `Dashboard` as the Type and enter `https://github.com/ChevronTango/nationalrail-status-card` as the repository. Save and refresh.

3. Find `Nationalrail Status Card` in the HACS store and select install.

### Manual install

1. Download and copy `nationalrail-status-card.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ChevronTango/nationalrail-status-card/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

2. Add the resource reference as decribed below.


### CLI install

1. Move into your `config/www` directory.

2. Grab `nationalrail-status-card.js`:

  ```
  $ wget https://github.com/ChevronTango/ha-nationalrail-status-card/releases/download/v0.0.1/nationalrail-status-card.js
  ```

3. Add the resource reference as decribed below.

### Add resource reference

If you configure Lovelace via YAML, add a reference to `nationalrail-status-card.js` inside your `configuration.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/nationalrail-status-card.js?v=0.0.1
      type: module
  ```

Else, if you prefer the graphical editor, use the menu to add the resource:

1. Make sure, advanced mode is enabled in your user profile (click on your user name to get there)
2. Navigate to Configuration -> Lovelace Dashboards -> Resources Tab. Hit orange (+) icon
3. Enter URL `/local/nationalrail-status-card.js` and select type "JavaScript Module".
(Use `/hacsfiles/nationalrail-status-card/nationalrail-status-card.js` and select "JavaScript Module" for HACS install)
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Using the card

1. Install the [National Rail API Integration](https://github.com/jfparis/homeassistant_nationalrail).

2. Add a new device from the National Rail API Integration with a source and destination station. Only trains with a direct connection from the source to the destination will appear. Trains that require an interchange will not display.

3. In your dashboard add a New Card and select the `National Rail Status Card`.

4. Select the entity for your station and destination, and optionally choose the number of trains to display. Click Save.

## Integration Compatibility

This card works with the National Rail API Integration for Home Assistant:

### Standard Integration
- **Repository**: [jfparis/homeassistant_nationalrail](https://github.com/jfparis/homeassistant_nationalrail)
- **Features**: Basic train schedule data (terminus, scheduled/expected times, platform, calling points)

### Enhanced Integration ⭐ Recommended
- **Repository**: [tombanbury-cyber/homeassistant_nationalrail](https://github.com/tombanbury-cyber/homeassistant_nationalrail)
- **Additional Features**: 
  - Train operator name (e.g., "Great Western Railway", "Southern")
  - Service type information
  - Train length (number of carriages)
  - Fully compatible with all card features

### Feature Compatibility Matrix

| Card Feature | Standard Integration | Enhanced Integration |
|--------------|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Basic train list | ✅ | ✅ |
| Platform display | ✅ | ✅ |
| Platform grouping | ✅ | ✅ |
| Platform filtering | ✅ | ✅ |
| Status indicators | ✅ | ✅ |
| Operator display | ❌ | ✅ |
| Service type display | ❌ | ✅ |
| Train length display | ❌ | ✅ |

**Note**: The card will automatically detect and display additional fields when using the enhanced integration. If fields are not available, they will be gracefully hidden.

## Getting errors?
Make sure you have `javascript_version: latest` in your `configuration.yaml` under `frontend:`.
